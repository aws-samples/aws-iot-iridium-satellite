## AWS IoT - Iridium Satellite

# Projects

- [sbd-getting-started](sbd-getting-started/README.md) Information you need to use Iridium CloudConnect for SBD solution in the AWS Cloud. It also comes with an AWS CloudFormation template to deploy the infrastructure needed for the service to work.

- [imt-getting-started](imt-getting-started/README.md) Information you need to use Iridium CloudConnect for IMT solution in the AWS Cloud. It also comes with an AWS CloudFormation template to deploy the infrastructure needed for the service to work.

- [sbd-iridium-cloudconnect-with-aws-iot-core](sbd-iridium-cloudconnect-with-aws-iot-core/README.md) Shows how to take messages from an SQS queue, move them into DynamoDB automatically, and build an API on top of IoT Core that allows other systems to query the data in DynamoDB.

- [imt-iridium-cloudconnect-with-eventbridge](imt-iridium-cloudconnect-with-eventbridge/README.md) This project aims to facilitate communication between IoT devices using Iridium satellites and other services hosted in AWS. It leverages AWS services like Amazon EventBridge, Amazon API Gateways, AWS IoT Core and Amazon DynamoDB to handle, route and process data transmitted to and from IoT devices via Iridium satellite communications.
